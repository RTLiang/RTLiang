Even though I am keen on computer science, what I focus on is the whole tech industry, like latest news of companies or deploy some interesting projects from GitHub. Recently I just opened my first PR[^1](well, technically not the first but I regard as first because previous PRs are just not that important) one of my favorite project. 
# How do I know this project
The Project is called [Windrecorder](https://github.com/yuka-friends/Windrecorder), basically it is a tool that record your screen incase you will need something in the future. But for me, it is also a tool to investigate unauthorized access of my own computer[^2].
