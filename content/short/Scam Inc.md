Recently I listened a podcast called Scam Inc[^1], it is well produced, yet horrifying. Sue-Lin Wong[^2]'s podcasts never disappoint me, no matter The Prince[^3] a few years ago, or Scam Inc this year. With detailed story and analytics, in-depth interview with experts and related individuals, she revealed the underground industry of scamming, which "steal" billions of money from innocent people all over the world.

[FEB 23 2025] Update:

My favorite episode is the last episode *A humble approach*. Unlike other episodes uncovering how innocent people get scammed, this episode, on the contrary, focus on what happens after getting scammed.
