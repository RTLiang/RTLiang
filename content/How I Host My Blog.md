this is a simple collection of resources that I use for hosting the blog

### 1. Host with Quartz
**refer to [How to publish Obsidian notes with Quartz on GitHub Pages - Fork My Brain](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages#How%20to%20publish%20Obsidian%20notes%20with%20Quartz%20on%20GitHub%20Pages)**

### 2. Image uploading using Cloudflare R2
**refer to [使用Cloudflare R2 + PicGo实现免费图床 - Indie Hacker Tool (Chinese)](https://www.indiehackertool.com/blog/cloudflare-r2-picgo)** 

[Manually install PicGo Plugins when plugin store can not load **(Chinese)**](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo/issues/222#issuecomment-699451233)
[GitHub repo of picgo-plugin-s3 **(Chinese)**](https://github.com/wayjam/picgo-plugin-s3)

## Known issues
1. obsidian takes centuries to load (until the official `sync` plugin is on)
