this is a simple collection of resources that I use for hosting the blog

## 1. Host with Quartz
**refer to [How to publish Obsidian notes with Quartz on GitHub Pages - Fork My Brain](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages#How%20to%20publish%20Obsidian%20notes%20with%20Quartz%20on%20GitHub%20Pages)**
### Links maybe useful
[Quartz Official Document](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)

## 2. Image uploading using Cloudflare R2
**refer to [使用Cloudflare R2 + PicGo实现免费图床 - Indie Hacker Tool (Chinese)](https://www.indiehackertool.com/blog/cloudflare-r2-picgo)** 
### Links maybe useful

## 3. Auto redirect
When building GitHub Pages with Quartz, the default link is `https://yourusername.github.io/my-notes`, what we want is `https://yourusername.github.io`.

What you need is setting up a redirect page in `https://yourusername.github.io`, redirect to `https://yourusername.github.io/my-notes`

eg:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // Check if the current page is not already at the redirect URL
        if (window.location.pathname !== '/my-notes') {
            window.location.href = "https://yourusername.github.io/my-notes";
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>If you are not redirected automatically, <a href="https://yourusername.github.io/my-notes">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
