During a class session, where we were assigned to write a Unity project according to a video tutorial, it was simple but time-consuming, we are free to go out of the classroom. The deadline is tomorrow, the stealer seated near me, his progress was far behind, he thought he was not able to complete the task and fail the course, which would lead him failing to get the chance to get admitted by the postgraduate school. Around 4:05, I went out of the classroom, leaving my laptop screen on, unlocked.

Most of the time, when I leave my laptop, I lock the screen. But this time, out of mercy, I intentionally leave it for him, thought he may refer from what I did.

When I came back (Around 4:25), my laptop screen was still on, there were a few reasons: 1. It was used within 15 minutes. 2. some programs or glitches prevented screen from dimming (turned out it was the first one). But I ignored, thought it was just some bugs (there are many bugs in windows indeed, but not this time).

Later that hour, he asked if I still have the apk file (we are asked to compile an apk file and run it on an Android device, this task is the same for student who enrolled this course). "Yes", I said, "Then send it to me", "How?". The Android device I used is an old device, I logged out of all my social account, and it didn't have any Internet connection, the only way to send files was via wired connection. 

Two hours later, when I came back from dinner, he moved away from me, seated with his "mates".

I successfully passed the examination of the project. He was still with his "mates" dealing with "additional project"(which provided bonus score, and I didn't do it).

I discovered something strange in my google drive, an apk file was in the root folder of my google drive, I didn't recall I'd uploaded it before. Clicking its activity, everything was clear.

There was only one way to upload a file and share to a person at the same time: Gmail. The maximum file size of attachment of email is 25MB, the apk file was over 40MB, thus, Gmail uploaded into my drive and sent a attachment link instead[^1]. Turned out, yes. He was smart, he deleted the email but not permanently, leaving it in my trash bin. I recovered it.

More evidence were shown as I investigated, browser history, after sending the email, he searched his email in the search bar to find that email, and deleted. The traffic log also showed he used Gmail at that time.
