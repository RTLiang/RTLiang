Recently I read a article in Hacker News titled [Why Blog If Nobody Reads It? | Andy's Blog](https://andysblog.uk/why-blog-if-nobody-reads-it/) which discussed reasons why we still blogging even though nobody reads. The comment section of HN is really interesting btw [Why blog if nobody reads it? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992159).

It reminds me that a few years ago, I also wanted to start my own blog, but it was more like a dairy instead of a blog, and I gave up in the end. I also tried writing newsletters called Revue as a form of blogging, but in 2023, this platform was shutdown [^1]. Medium and Notion are also good platforms of blogging, but they both have a fatal problem: I don't have my own posts in my own computer. In the end, I decided use Obsidian to write my blog and GitHub Pages to host it [How I Host My Blog (not out yet, but soon!)](How%20I%20Host%20My%20Blog.md), ensuring data are stored securely.

Back to the article, probably nobody reads my blog, but I insist start writing it, the reason behind is that I wanted to keep my mind clear, just as the blog says:

>Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.

And a video also inspired me to do so [(Chinese) 人工智能与人类终局](https://youtu.be/5ieOxxXcl8U?t=1604). In short, what I need to do is to keep lowering the entropy of the tiny system, fighting with the exponential growing entropy of the entire system.
